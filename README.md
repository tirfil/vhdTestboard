# vhdTestboard
FPGA testboard project (need a key and a led).

Goal is to check FPGA board. FPGA board contains usually at least a key and a led.

We check the behavior on spartan6 and cyclone II board.

This project includes a key debouncer and a blinking led FSM. 

Spartan6: 54/11,440 slice registers &  60/5,720 slice LUT
